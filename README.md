The human gut harbors a diverse community of microorganisms collectively known as the gut microbiota, which plays a pivotal role in various aspects of human health, encompassing metabolism and immune function. Recent research has begun to unravel the potential links between alterations in the gut microbiota and the development of metabolic disorders, including obesity. This article delves into the intricate relationship between the gut microbiota and obesity, shedding light on the existing evidence and potential mechanisms involved. Emerging evidence highlights the association between changes in gut microbiota composition and function and obesity, thereby suggesting that the gut microbiota's composition could hold significant predictive information for the early diagnosis and prognosis of obesity. In this project, we harnessed the power of machine learning algorithms to predict obesity status using taxa and functional information derived from the gut microbiota of 247 human samples. Our findings demonstrated high predictive accuracy (AUC-ROC = 0.95) and allowed for the identification of key taxa and pathways implicated in obesity. To make our predictive model accessible to the research community, we developed a user-friendly data science solution featuring both a command line interface and a graphical interface.
